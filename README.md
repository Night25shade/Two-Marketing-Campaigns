# Two-Marketing-Campaigns

The purpose of this analysis is to preprocess marketing data, calculate various metrics, and generate insights that might be challenging or time-consuming to accomplish directly in Excel. The report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the marketing data, identify key performance metrics, and gain insights into the profitability and performance of different marketing campaigns and search keywords.

By Python Scripting, the analysis becomes more efficient and enables the creation of dynamic visualizations and data summaries, which may not be easily achievable in Excel. The insights obtained from the analysis can help stakeholders make informed decisions and optimize their marketing strategies based on the most profitable campaigns and search keywords.
